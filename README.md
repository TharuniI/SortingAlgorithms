# Sorting Algorithms 
Here is a compilation of codes I have written for different sorting algorithms.

# Installations
You will need Java and Python on your text-editor or IDE in order to compile the code.

# Usage
In order to complile the code, run the following commands on Ubuntu terminal for Java:
```bash
javac filename.java
java filename
```

Run the following commands on Ubuntu terminal for Python:
```bash
python filename.py
```

#Contributors 
The Linear Sort and Heap Sort algorithms were created with fellow contributor deepan-patel.
